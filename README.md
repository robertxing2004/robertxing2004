## hi! my name is robert (he/him)
### i'm an engineering student and software developer ðŸŒ”

Like I said, I'm an engineering student (woohoo!) at Western University. I'm interested in product/project management, fullstack development, iOS development, UI design, and machine learning. 

Aside from school and work, I enjoy travelling all over the world and taking lots of photos! I also have a huge love for aviation, and I hope to get my Canadian private pilot's license once I have the time and money(lol) to do so! I'm currently developing a few side projects, one of which is a personal portfolio, where I'll put everything me-related. At the moment, I'm in the process of converting the WIP to a Vue.js app.

}
```

### what i'm up to ðŸŒ¿
I just started my first year of university, and I'm super excited to meet a whole lot of new people and shape the next chapter of my life! In my free time I'm working on my side projects, enjoying social time with friends and learning about cool new technologies in the phone, computer, photo/video, drone, and electric vehicle sectors.
