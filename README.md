## hi! my name is robert (he/him)
### i'm an engineering student and software developer ðŸŒ”

Like I said, I'm an engineering student (woohoo!) at Western University. I'm interested in product/project management, fullstack development, iOS development, UI/UX design, and machine learning. 

Aside from school and work, I enjoy travelling all over the world and taking lots of photos! I also have a huge love for aviation, and I hope to get my Canadian private pilot's license once I have the time and money(lol) to do so! I'm currently developing a few side projects, one of which is a personal portfolio, where I'll put everything me-related. At the moment, I'm in the process of converting the WIP to a React.js app.

```json
{
  "name": "robert xing",
  "school": "western university",
  "program": "software engineering",
  "year": "second year",
  "seeking internships": true,
  "goal": "to build sustainable tech for social good"
}
```

### what i'm up to ðŸŒ¿
Currently looking forward to my second year of university. I'm spending the summer contributing to open source projects, working on some personal side projects, and playing sports and video games.
